# Saahil Ahmed's Portfolio

Hi there! I'm a passionate **Game Developer** specializing in robust systems and gameplay programming, with a strong focus on writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. I possess excellent problem-solving abilities and always strive to create smooth, responsive, and engaging gameplay experiences. My expertise lies in **Unreal Engine 5**, **C++**, and **Blueprints**, where I build immersive gameplay systems, responsive AI, and scalable architectures that empower both players and developers. From rapid prototyping to polished, performance-optimized releases â€” I bring ideas to life.

## Featured Projects

### Hack and Slash Template | UE5, Blueprints & C++  
**May 2025**  
A modular, extensible combat framework designed for fast-paced melee action.

- Built a **modular combat system** in UE5 using **C++** for core architecture and **Blueprints** for rapid prototyping.
- Designed **data-driven combos** (via Data Assets) and **responsive enemy AI** with Behaviour Trees (Patrol/Aggro states).
- Implemented a **player state machine** (Idle, Moving, Attacking, Blocking) for fluid combat transitions.
- Enhanced combat feel with **hit-stop**, **screen shake**, **VFX**, **SFX**, and **dynamic UI** (health bars, AI mode toggles).
- Developed **scalable health & attack components** (C++) for reuse across players, enemies, and destructibles.
- Optimized for **performance** and **extensibility**, with clean code documentation for team collaboration.

### Space Rangers | UE5, Blueprints  
**Dec 2024 â€“ Jan 2025**  
A retro-inspired arcade shooter with modern gameplay polish.

- Developed an **arcade shooter** entirely in **Blueprints**.
- Utilized **Behaviour Trees** for AI movement and shooting patterns.
- Implemented **three unique attack types** and orthographic enemies (Bomber, Shooter, etc.).
- Finalized the **3 Câ€™s** (Character, Controller, Camera) through rapid iteration.

### CPPFPS | UE5, C++  
**Nov 2024**  
A fully modular first-person shooter built in just **7 days**.

- Developed entirely in **C++**, focusing on **efficient system architecture**.
- Created a **data-driven spawning system** by fetching JSON data online, deserializing it, and dynamically spawning objects based on **7 parsed attributes**.
- Managed the **score system** within GameMode, dynamically attaching UIWidgets to the active pawn for real-time updates.
- Implemented a **component-based architecture** for maximum reusability and flexibility.
